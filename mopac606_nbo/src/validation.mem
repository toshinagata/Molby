                   Validation Tests for MOPAC, Version 6.00


                       +*+*  Public Domain Version +*+*



        When MOPAC is converted for use on a new computer, validation tests
   should  be run in order to confirm that no degradation in the quality of
   results has occurred.  To assist with this validation,  a  set  of  test
   cases  has  been  constructed.  While not exhaustive, these tests do put
   MOPAC through its paces.  MOPAC Version 6.00 passes all tests when a VAX
   computer is used.

        After the conversion to allow  it  to  run  on  a  new  machine  is
   complete, MOPAC should be run using the test-set.  Only the VAX COM file
   is given.  Users with other machines should read this COM file, and  try
   to  figure out what was done.  Essentially, each data set is run through
   MOPAC.  In rare cases  intermediate  output  is  deliberately  corrupted
   before the test is continued.

        A fast way of checking the tests is to use the VAX SEARCH  or  UNIX
   "grep" command to check the heat of formation.  The form of this test is

   $SEARCH *.OUT HEAT
   $SEARCH *.OUT "NT NO"  (short for "GRADIENT NORM")
   >grep "HEAT" *.out
   >grep "NT NO" *.out
    Do not rely only on these tests, the charges printed may be quite wrong,
   even when the heat of formation, etc, were correct.


                             Stringency of Tests

        1.  Timings are machine-specific, and are not important.

        2.  Heats of formation should be accurate to within 0.001 Kcal/mol,
            unless a lower precision is specified.

        3.  All gradient norms (just below the  FINAL  HEAT  OF  FORMATION)
            should be below 1.0 Kcal/mol unless specifically noted.

        4.  All other quantities should be within 0.1% of the value given.




                 Errors already encountered in porting MOPAC

        1.  Heats of formation grossly in error -- conversion fault.

        2.  Charges faulty in final output -- compiler error.

        3.  Unexpected failure to go SCF -- mantissa too short.

        4.  Unequal COMMON blocks -- double to single precision conversion.
            (not important).


                                      i
        5.  Date or CPU time incorrect  --  local  function  not  correctly
            installed.

        6.  Restart function does not work  --  unformatted  files  wrongly
            handled.

        7.  More than one MOPAC job cannot be run -- COM file error.




        If, after trying to correct all faults, MOPAC still does  not  pass
   all  tests, and you think it should, then please give me a call at (719)
   472-2655.  It might be that  our  tests  are  too  stringent,  and  that
   relaxing  one  or  more  criteria  would  allow  a  modified MOPAC to be
   validated.



        Even when all tests are passed, hidden bugs may  still  exist.   If
   extensive changes were necessary in order to shoehorn MOPAC into a given
   machine, then the likelyhood of hidden bugs rises.   To  minimize  this,
   make  only  the minimum changes necessary to get MOPAC to run.  Even the
   master copy of MOPAC is not bug-free, the only assertion made is that it
   passes  all  of  our  tests, and we have no reason to suspect any hidden
   bugs exist.
