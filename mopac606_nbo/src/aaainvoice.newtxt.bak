  All the above files, or their equivalents, are contained in 
  QCPE 455 (MOPAC).  In addition to the above files, a set of 
  test-data is available for use in testing MOPAC ported to other 
  machines.  This test-data consists of the following files. 

  1scf.dat   elements.dat   force.dat   geometry.dat   keys.dat   
  oldgeo.dat PARAS.DAT      mnrsd1.dat  testdata.dat

  For each file, there is a <filename>.out which contains the output from
the file, run on a DEC-3100.  The <filename>.out files can be deleted if
space is at a premium.  To test the SETUP and EXTERNAL options, you
will need to use: mnrsd3.key, PARAS.DAT, and testdata.dat.
