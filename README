- Interactive modification of molecular models by mouse operation.
- Viewing and editing atomic coordinates and other parameters in numeric tables.
- Importing and exporting structure/coordinate data for other program packages such as Gaussian, GAMESS, NAMD and SHELX.
- Embedded Ruby interpreter for automated processing of molecular models.

2. Supported Platforms

Molby runs on Mac OS X (10.12 and later) and Microsoft Windows (XP and later). Executable binaries are provided for both platforms (MolbyMac.zip for Mac, SetupMolby.exe for Windows).
